    <h2>Why Donate Blood?</h2>
    <p>Donating blood is a simple and selfless act that can save lives and make a lasting impact. Every few seconds, someone somewhere needs blood for surgeries, accidents, or illnesses such as cancer and anemia. A single donation can help up to three people and ensures that hospitals have enough supply for emergencies. Besides saving lives, donating blood also benefits the donor by stimulating new blood cell production and offering a quick health checkup. It is a safe, noble, and rewarding way to give back to the community — because a few minutes of your time can mean a lifetime for someone else.</p>
